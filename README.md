# Energy Calculator

This is a super simple energy usage and bill calculator.

I built this because I was going through the hell on earth that is dealing with my energy provider and I needed a fast and simple way to calculate my energy usage and what I should owe based on my meter readings.

Also why do maths when a computer could do it for you?

The calculations are based on the UK energy bills but could be modified for elsewhere.

This code is a little messy I know, but it works, I didn't have much time to do this, please feel free to improve it.
